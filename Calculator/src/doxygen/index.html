Chapter I</h1>
<p><img src="smartcalcv2.0_my.png" alt="" class="inline" title="smartcalcv2.0"/>    </p>
<p>Planet Earth, USA, California, somewhere in Cupertino, 20 August 1983.</p>
<p>Chris put a paper cup of coffee next to you on the table, so that woke you up.</p>
<p><em>&ndash; Pure black americano, I heard you like it. It'll help you wake up.</em></p>
<p><em>- Oh, yes, I really need it, thanks. Where were we?</em> - you asked, drinking your hot coffee.</p>
<p><em>&ndash; Did you finish the basic logic for the calculator?</em></p>
<p><em>- Ah, it's still in progress. The meeting with Steve will be tomorrow?</em></p>
<p><em>&ndash; That's right. If we can show him some basic arithmetic operations with a refactored program structure, I think he'll like it.</em></p>
<p>For more than a week now, you've been helping Chris Espinosa rewrite an object-oriented calculator in the evenings. Its latest version in the standard structured approach turned out to be not flexible and extensible enough for Steve Jobs who was bursting with ideas. So, you and Chris decided to try the emerging object-oriented programming paradigm in the young C++ language to solve these problems. Of course, learning new technologies caused some... difficulties, but there is hope that it will not be necessary to completely rewrite the calculator for the eighth time.</p>
<p><em>- Well, then, let's speed it up.</em></p>
<p><em>&ndash; By the way, I crossed paths with a developer from Norway the other day: Torkve or Trykve, I don't remember.</em> \ <em>Anyway, he told me about one scheme for organizing data and application logic, which allows us to change some components very flexibly and quickly. For example, we can completely separate the interface from the rest of the code, you know? And if Steve doesn't like something in the interface again, it can be changed quickly and safely. We wouldn't even need to rewrite the tests for the rest of the logic.</em></p>
<p><em>- Sounds like exactly what we need! I'm all ears.</em></p>

Introduction</h1>
<p>In this project youâ€™ll need to implement an extended version of the standard calculator in C++ in the object-oriented programming paradigm, implementing the same functions as the previously developed application in SmartCalc v1.0 project. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, you need to supplement the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions by following the order, as well as some mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.). Besides calculating expressions, it should also support the use of the <em>x</em> variable and the graphing of the corresponding function. As for other improvements you can consider a credit and deposit calculator.</p>

Information</h1>
<p>Note that you should use <em>Dijkstra's algorithm</em> to translate expressions into <em>reverse Polish notation</em> to implement the calculator. You can find all the necessary information in the SmartCalc v1.0 project description to refresh your knowledge.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
MVC pattern</h2>
<p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a scheme of separating application modules into three macro-components: a model that contains the business logic, a view that is a UI form to interact with the program, and a controller that modifies the model by user action.</p>
<p>The concept of MVC was introduced by Trygve Reenskaug in 1978, who was working on the Smalltalk programming language at Xerox PARC. Later, Steve Burbeck implemented the pattern in Smalltalk-80. The final version of the MVC concept was published in the journal Technology Object in 1988. The MVC pattern subsequently evolved, giving rise to variants such as HMVC, MVA, MVVM.</p>
<p>The main need for this pattern stems from the developers' desire to separate the business logic of the program from the views, which makes it easy to replace views and to reuse logic that has been implemented once in other environments. A model separated from the view and a controller to interact with it allows you to reuse or modify already written code more efficiently.</p>
<p>The model stores and accesses the main data, performs operations on requests, defined by the business logic of the program that means it is in charge of the part of the program responsible for all algorithms and information processing. These models, modified by the controller, affect the information display on the user interface. The model in this program should be the class library that performs the calculations. This library must provide all the necessary classes and methods to perform them. And this is the business logic of the program, because it provides the means to solve the problem.</p>
<p>A controller is a thin macro component that performs model modifications. It is used to generate requests for it. In code, it looks like a kind of "facade" for the model that means a set of methods that already work directly with the model. It is called thin because the ideal controller contains no additional logic other than calling one or more methods of the model. The controller serves as a link between the interface and the model. This allows the model to be fully encapsulated from the display. This separation is helpful in that it allows the view code to know nothing about the model code and to address only the controller, whose interface of the provided functions will probably be not changed much. The model, on the other hand, can undergo significant changes, and if you "move" to other algorithms, technologies, or even programming languages in the model, only a small section of code in the controller directly related to the model will need to be changed. Otherwise, it would probably be necessary to rewrite a significant part of the interface code, as it would depend a lot on the implementation of the model. So, when interacting with the interface, the user calls controller methods that modify the model.</p>
<p>The view includes all code associated with the program interface. An ideal interface code should not contain any business logic. It only represents the form for interaction with the user.</p>

Part 1. Implementation of SmartCalc v2.0</h1>
<p>You need to implement the SmartCalc v2.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard</li>
<li>The program code must be located in the src folder</li>
<li>When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style</li>
<li>Classes must be implemented within the <code>vv</code> namespace</li>
<li>Prepare full coverage of expression calculation modules with unit-tests using the GTest library</li>
<li>The program must be built with Makefile which contains standard set of targets for GNU-programs: all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests. Installation directory could be arbitrary</li>
<li>GUI implementation, based on any GUI library with API for C++17:<ul>
<li>For Linux: GTK+, CEF, Qt, JUCE</li>
<li>For Mac: GTK+, CEF, Qt, JUCE, SFML, Nanogui, Nngui</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The program must be implemented using the MVC pattern, and also:<ul>
<li>there should be no business logic code in the view code</li>
<li>there should be no interface code in the controller and the model</li>
<li>controllers must be thin</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Both integers and real numbers with a dot can be input into the program. You should provide the input of numbers in exponential notation</li>
